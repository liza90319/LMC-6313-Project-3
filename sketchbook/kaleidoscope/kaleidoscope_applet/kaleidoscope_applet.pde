/**
 * Picture Kaleidoscope (Applet Version)
 * by David Buchmann <mail at davidbu.ch>
 *
 * The image is a part of a painting done by my mother, see
 * http://www.catherinebuchmann.ch
 *
 * I RECOMMEND TO DOWNLOAD THE STANDALONE APPLICATION FOR A NICER EXPERIENCE
 * http://davidbu.ch/mann/blog/2011-05-15/picture-kaleidoscope-processing.html
 *
 * Move mouse to change image part that is shown
 *   - left button pressed to move the image
 *   - right button and move left and right to rotate
 *
 * Keys:
 *   - 0 to 9: set number of mirror axis
 *   - r / R: accelerate/decelerate rotation of the resulting image
 *
 *
 * I did not manage to do opengl in applet. this version uses JAVA2D and is
 * painfully slow
